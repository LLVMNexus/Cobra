1.0 dec 2016

2.0 may 2017

2.1 jul 2017

2.2 july 2017
- bug fix: used realloc after sbrk for multiple
  preprocessing directives were used, causing crash

2.3 aug 2017
- no default setting of nr of cores
- using a preprocessing directive enables cpp

2.4 oct 2017
- added -pat and -pattern for matching simpler regex patterns
- added -expr and -regex as synonyms of -e
- added inline pat command
- added visual display of source on d commands
- made -pat/-expr pipelines work
+ disabled call to fct_defs in 'list' commands
  if the nr of tokens is greater than 500,000 (linux 10/26)

2.5 aug 2018
- bug fixes (e.g., tests for . == 0 or . != 0 came out wrong)
- allowing use of globals inside functions
- added a few cwe checkers

2.6 oct 2018
- rules/cwe library added for ten top cwe vulnerabilities
  (not yet in the distributed version)
- added window and nowindow command, new default is nowindow
  (for popping up a tcl/tk window on display commands)
- fixed: bug in command language interpreter (condition evals)

2.7 nov 2018
- fixed: bug that global arrays werent visible inside functions
- fixed: strings or quoted character now terminated at unescaped newlines
- fixed: {} imbalance on files that arent preprocessed with cpp
- added: -eol option
- added: some additional fct calls to c_api.h and c.ar (eg timing)

2.8 feb 2019
- added 'and' qualifier to contains command (and updated manpage)
- reduced cache misses in multi-core mode significantly

2.9 mar 2019
- fixed missing lock in code for "match()" in cobra_prog.y which could
  cause occassional segfaults when executing scripts in multicore mode

3.0 jun 2019
- extensions to the pattern language, allowing embedded regular
  expressions in pattern expressions
- new predefined functions that can be used in cobra scripts:
  reset(), fcts(), save(), restore(), marks()
- updated online manpages
- new library query files
- extension of command query save, to allow |,&, and ^ modifiers
- bug fixes and speedups for multi-core processing
- full source code and libraries released on github
- after initial release on github, made following updates:
  - fixed a line number bug where // style comments had a linenr
    attribute one too high
  - added C_TMP environment variable, explained in the main README.md
    relevant only to older cygwin/pc platforms where 'dot' otherwise
    can't find /tmp
  - corrected "malloc.h" -> "stdlib.h" for compilation on macs
  - made query commands 'context' and 'fcg' work correctly again
  - fixed bug with using cpp on/off interactively
  - created tagged commit for the final 3.0 version dated June 12 2019
    tag: version-3.0

3.1 nov 2019
  - correctly interpret a 'q' command when a script is read from a file
  - updated rules/play/taint.cobra
  - added checks to prevent null-ptr derefs
  - fixed reference to an out-of-scope variable, detected by coverity scan
  - fewer warnings about redefined labels when rerunning scripts
  - fixed bug with pattern searches that limited alternative choices of
    how bindings were applied
  - rewrote the encoding of associative arrays for the scripting language
    to make it considerably faster when dealing with larger arrays
  - added a -text option to suppress the categorization of tokens, which
    is especially useful when using cobra as a runtime verification tool
    on data other than program source text
  - revised how cobra reads data from stdin in no files are given. the
    data is now read in portions, so that cobra can maintain a sliding
    window on an event-stream, and check scripted queries, or pattern
    queries on a potentially infinite data stream (provided the memory
    requirements for the check remains bounded).
    by splitting the data-stream it is also possible to then check
    multiple properties in parallel.
  - many other small improvements and fixes in the query libraries, the
    main source code in src, and in the standalone checkers in src_app,
    especially in the standalone version of the cwe checkers, which are
    now all recoded to support multi-core checks
  - added online tutorials for the all existing capabilities of cobra
    verison 3.1, including the new runtime verification options.
